# Close Sprint Skill

Completes sprints by reviewing completion status, calculating velocity, archiving the sprint, and generating completion reports. Helps teams learn from each sprint and improve planning accuracy.

## Philosophy

> Sprint closure is learning, not just completion.

Closing a sprint is an opportunity to reflect, learn, and improve. It's about understanding what worked, what didn't, and how to do better next time. This skill ensures sprints are closed thoughtfully, grounded in love for continuous improvement and trust in the team's ability to learn.

## When to Use

- When sprint end date arrives
- When user mentions "close sprint", "sprint retrospective", "sprint review", "complete sprint"
- At the end of sprint cycle
- When calculating team velocity
- When generating sprint reports
- When archiving completed work

## Prerequisites

Before closing sprint, ensure:
1. PM backend is configured (via `pm-configuration` skill)
2. Sprint ID is available
3. Sprint work is complete (or will be reviewed)

## Process

### Step 1: Identify Sprint to Close

Determine which sprint to close:

```
"I'll help you close a sprint. Which sprint should we close?

A) Current active sprint: {SPRINT_NAME}
B) Specific sprint: {SPRINT_ID or SPRINT_NAME}
C) List all active sprints

[If user doesn't specify, default to current sprint]"
```

### Step 2: Review Sprint Status

Query sprint items and status:

**Backend Operation:** `getSprint`

**Parameters:**
```json
{
  "sprintId": "{SPRINT_ID}"
}
```

**Backend Operation:** `listItems`

**Parameters:**
```json
{
  "sprintId": "{SPRINT_ID}",
  "projectId": "{PROJECT_ID}"
}
```

**Analyze completion:**

```
"📊 **Sprint Review: {SPRINT_NAME}**

**Sprint Details:**
- **Dates:** {START_DATE} to {END_DATE}
- **Goal:** {SPRINT_GOAL}
- **Planned Points:** {PLANNED_POINTS} pts

**Completion Status:**

✅ **Completed:**
- {ITEM_1}: {TITLE} ({POINTS} pts)
- {ITEM_2}: {TITLE} ({POINTS} pts)
- **Total:** {COMPLETED_COUNT} items, {COMPLETED_POINTS} pts

🔄 **In Progress:**
- {ITEM_3}: {TITLE} ({POINTS} pts) - {PROGRESS}%
- **Total:** {IN_PROGRESS_COUNT} items, {IN_PROGRESS_POINTS} pts

❌ **Not Started:**
- {ITEM_4}: {TITLE} ({POINTS} pts)
- **Total:** {NOT_STARTED_COUNT} items, {NOT_STARTED_POINTS} pts

**Completion Rate:**
- Items: {COMPLETED_COUNT} / {TOTAL_COUNT} ({PERCENTAGE}%)
- Points: {COMPLETED_POINTS} / {PLANNED_POINTS} ({PERCENTAGE}%)

**⚠️ Items to Handle:**
- {IN_PROGRESS_COUNT} items still in progress
- {NOT_STARTED_COUNT} items not started

**Options:**
A) Close sprint as-is (move incomplete items to backlog)
B) Extend sprint by {DAYS} days
C) Move incomplete items to next sprint
D) Review each item individually
"
```

### Step 3: Handle Incomplete Items

Decide what to do with incomplete work:

**Option A: Move to Backlog**
```
"Moving incomplete items to backlog..."
```

**Backend Operation:** `updateStatus`

For each incomplete item:
```json
{
  "itemId": "{ITEM_ID}",
  "status": "Backlog"
}
```

**Option B: Move to Next Sprint**
```
"Moving incomplete items to next sprint: {NEXT_SPRINT_NAME}"
```

**Backend Operation:** `addToSprint`

For each item to carry over:
```json
{
  "sprintId": "{NEXT_SPRINT_ID}",
  "itemId": "{ITEM_ID}"
}
```

**Option C: Review Individually**
```
"Let's review each incomplete item:

**{ITEM_TITLE}** ({POINTS} pts)
- Current Status: {STATUS}
- Progress: {PROGRESS}%
- Options:
  A) Complete now (mark as done)
  B) Move to backlog
  C) Move to next sprint
  D) Cancel (won't do)

[Repeat for each item]"
```

### Step 4: Calculate Velocity

Calculate sprint velocity:

**Backend Operation:** `getVelocity`

**Parameters:**
```json
{
  "projectId": "{PROJECT_ID}",
  "sprintCount": 1,
  "sprintId": "{SPRINT_ID}"
}
```

**Calculate metrics:**

```
"📈 **Velocity Calculation**

**This Sprint:**
- Planned: {PLANNED_POINTS} pts
- Completed: {COMPLETED_POINTS} pts
- Velocity: {COMPLETED_POINTS} pts

**Last 3 Sprints:**
- Sprint {N-2}: {POINTS} pts
- Sprint {N-1}: {POINTS} pts
- Sprint {N}: {POINTS} pts

**Average Velocity:** {AVG_POINTS} pts
**Trend:** {TREND} ({INCREASE/DECREASE/STABLE})

**Velocity Insights:**
- {INSIGHT_1}
- {INSIGHT_2}
- {INSIGHT_3}
"
```

### Step 5: Generate Sprint Report

Create completion report:

```
"📋 **Sprint Completion Report: {SPRINT_NAME}**

**Sprint Summary:**
- **Dates:** {START_DATE} to {END_DATE}
- **Goal:** {SPRINT_GOAL}
- **Status:** ✅ Completed

**Work Completed:**
- **Stories:** {COMPLETED_STORIES} / {TOTAL_STORIES}
- **Tasks:** {COMPLETED_TASKS} / {TOTAL_TASKS}
- **Points:** {COMPLETED_POINTS} / {PLANNED_POINTS} pts
- **Completion Rate:** {PERCENTAGE}%

**Team Performance:**
- **Velocity:** {VELOCITY} pts
- **Average Velocity (3 sprints):** {AVG_VELOCITY} pts
- **Velocity Trend:** {TREND}

**Work Carried Over:**
- **To Backlog:** {BACKLOG_COUNT} items ({BACKLOG_POINTS} pts)
- **To Next Sprint:** {NEXT_SPRINT_COUNT} items ({NEXT_SPRINT_POINTS} pts)

**Key Achievements:**
- {ACHIEVEMENT_1}
- {ACHIEVEMENT_2}
- {ACHIEVEMENT_3}

**Challenges:**
- {CHALLENGE_1}
- {CHALLENGE_2}

**Lessons Learned:**
- {LEARNING_1}
- {LEARNING_2}

**Recommendations for Next Sprint:**
- {RECOMMENDATION_1}
- {RECOMMENDATION_2}
"
```

### Step 6: Close Sprint

Close the sprint in backend:

**Backend Operation:** `closeSprint`

**Parameters:**
```json
{
  "sprintId": "{SPRINT_ID}"
}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "{SPRINT_ID}",
  "status": "Closed",
  "completedAt": "{TIMESTAMP}",
  "velocity": {VELOCITY},
  "completionRate": {PERCENTAGE}
}
```

### Step 7: Archive Sprint Data

Archive sprint for historical reference:

```
"Sprint data archived:
- Sprint details saved
- Velocity recorded
- Completion report generated
- Historical data updated"
```

### Step 8: Confirm and Summarize

Present closed sprint:

```
"✅ Sprint closed successfully!

**Sprint:** {SPRINT_NAME}
**Status:** Closed
**Completed:** {END_DATE}

**Final Metrics:**
- Completed Points: {COMPLETED_POINTS} pts
- Velocity: {VELOCITY} pts
- Completion Rate: {PERCENTAGE}%

**Sprint Report:** {REPORT_URL}

**Next Steps:**
1. Review sprint report: {BACKEND_URL}
2. Conduct sprint retrospective (team meeting)
3. Plan next sprint (use plan-sprint skill)
4. Update velocity for future planning
5. Celebrate achievements! 🎉

## Sprint Closure Best Practices

### Handling Incomplete Work

- **Move to backlog** - If work is no longer priority
- **Carry to next sprint** - If work is still valuable
- **Complete now** - If nearly done, finish before closing
- **Cancel** - If work is no longer needed

### Velocity Calculation

- **Use completed points** - Only count fully completed work
- **Track consistently** - Use same definition across sprints
- **Consider context** - Account for holidays, team changes
- **Learn from trends** - Use velocity trends to improve planning

### Sprint Reports

- **Include metrics** - Completion rate, velocity, trends
- **Highlight achievements** - Celebrate completed work
- **Identify challenges** - Note blockers and issues
- **Provide recommendations** - Suggest improvements for next sprint

## Fallback Procedures

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| PM backend not configured | Guide user to run `pm-configuration` skill first |
| Sprint not found | List available sprints, ask user to select |
| Sprint already closed | Confirm closure, show sprint report |
| No items in sprint | Close sprint anyway, note empty sprint |
| Velocity calculation fails | Use manual calculation, suggest checking data |
| Incomplete items unclear | Ask user to review each item individually |
| Next sprint not found | Move items to backlog instead |

## Integration with Other Skills

### Integration with plan-sprint Skill

After closure:
```
"Now that sprint is closed, I can help plan the next sprint using the plan-sprint skill.
The velocity from this sprint ({VELOCITY} pts) will inform next sprint capacity."
```

### Integration with run-standup Skill

During sprint:
```
"During the sprint, use run-standup skill to track progress and identify blockers early."
```

### Integration with generate-burndown Skill

For sprint analysis:
```
"I can generate a burndown chart for this sprint using the generate-burndown skill to visualize progress."
```

### Integration with health-check Skill

Sprint data informs health:
```
"Sprint completion data contributes to team health metrics:
- Velocity trends
- Completion rates
- Carryover patterns"
```

## Important Rules

1. **Review before closing** - Always review sprint status before closing
2. **Handle incomplete work** - Decide what to do with incomplete items
3. **Calculate velocity accurately** - Only count completed work
4. **Generate reports** - Create completion reports for learning
5. **Archive data** - Save sprint data for historical reference
6. **Learn from metrics** - Use velocity trends to improve planning
7. **Celebrate achievements** - Acknowledge completed work
8. **Ground in improvement** - Focus on learning, not blame
