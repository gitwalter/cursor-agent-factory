# Create Epic Skill

Creates epics in the configured PM backend with proper structure and optional documentation linking. Epics serve as containers for related user stories, helping teams organize large initiatives into manageable work.

## Philosophy

> Epics organize vision into actionable work.

Epics bridge the gap between strategic goals and tactical execution. They provide structure without constraining creativity, allowing teams to see the forest while working on individual trees. This skill ensures epics are created with clarity and purpose, grounded in love for the team's mission and trust in their ability to deliver.

## When to Use

- When starting a new large feature or initiative
- When organizing multiple related user stories under a common theme
- When breaking down strategic goals into tactical work
- When user mentions "epic", "large feature", "initiative", "theme"
- During sprint planning when identifying work themes
- When creating project roadmap items

## Prerequisites

Before creating an epic, ensure:
1. PM backend is configured (via `pm-configuration` skill)
2. Project ID is available
3. Epic title and description are understood (or will be gathered)

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Epic Details

Collect essential information about the epic:

```
"I'll help you create an epic. Let me gather a few details:

**Epic Title:** 
[What should this epic be called?]

**Epic Description:**
[What is this epic trying to achieve? What problem does it solve?]

**Project:**
[Which project should this epic belong to?]
{PROJECT_ID}

**Optional - Child Stories:**
[Do you want to create initial user stories for this epic now, or add them later?]
- A) Create stories now (I'll help you define them)
- B) Add stories later
- C) Link existing stories

**Optional - Documentation:**
[Should I create a documentation page for this epic?]
- A) Yes, create a new page
- B) Link to existing page
- C) Skip documentation"
```

**Validation:**
- Title must be non-empty and descriptive
- Description should explain the "why" behind the epic
- Project ID must be valid

### Step 2: Create Epic in Backend

Call backend operation to create the epic:

**Backend Operation:** `createEpic`

**Parameters:**
```json
{
  "title": "{EPIC_TITLE}",
  "description": "{EPIC_DESCRIPTION}",
  "projectId": "{PROJECT_ID}"
}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "{EPIC_ID}",
  "title": "{EPIC_TITLE}",
  "description": "{EPIC_DESCRIPTION}",
  "status": "To Do",
  "projectId": "{PROJECT_ID}",
  "createdAt": "{TIMESTAMP}"
}
```

### Step 3: Create Child Stories (Optional)

If user selected option A in Step 1, help create initial stories:

```
"Let's create some initial stories for this epic. I'll help you break it down.

**Story 1:**
- Title: [What's the first story?]
- Description: [As a... / I want... / So that...]

[Continue for additional stories...]

Should I create these stories now and link them to the epic?"
```

For each story, use the `create-story` skill or call:

**Backend Operation:** `createStory`

**Parameters:**
```json
{
  "title": "{STORY_TITLE}",
  "description": "{STORY_DESCRIPTION}",
  "epicId": "{EPIC_ID}",
  "projectId": "{PROJECT_ID}"
}
```

### Step 4: Create Documentation Page (Optional)

If user selected to create documentation:

**Backend Operation:** `createPage`

**Parameters:**
```json
{
  "title": "{EPIC_TITLE} - Documentation",
  "content": "{EPIC_DESCRIPTION}\n\n## Goals\n\n## Stories\n\n## Success Criteria",
  "spaceId": "{SPACE_ID}",
  "parentId": null
}
```

Then link to the epic:

**Backend Operation:** `linkToWorkItem`

**Parameters:**
```json
{
  "pageId": "{PAGE_ID}",
  "itemId": "{EPIC_ID}"
}
```

### Step 5: Confirm and Summarize

Present the created epic with all details:

```
"✅ Epic created successfully!

**Epic Details:**
- **ID:** {EPIC_ID}
- **Title:** {EPIC_TITLE}
- **Status:** To Do
- **Project:** {PROJECT_ID}

**Child Stories:** {COUNT} stories
{STORY_LIST}

**Documentation:** {DOCUMENTATION_LINK or "Not created"}

**Next Steps:**
1. Review the epic in your PM backend: {BACKEND_URL}
2. Add more stories as you discover them
3. Move stories to sprints when ready
4. Update epic status as work progresses

The epic is ready for planning!"
```

## Integration with Other Skills

### Integration with create-story Skill

When creating child stories:
```
"To create stories for this epic, I can:
1. Use the create-story skill to properly format each story
2. Link them to this epic automatically
3. Validate story format (As a/I want/So that)"
```

### Integration with pm-configuration Skill

Epic creation requires PM backend:
```
"Before creating epics, ensure PM backend is configured.
If not configured, I'll guide you through pm-configuration first."
```

### Integration with plan-sprint Skill

Epics inform sprint planning:
```
"When planning sprints, I can:
1. Show all epics with their stories
2. Help prioritize epics for sprint inclusion
3. Track epic progress across sprints"
```

## Important Rules

1. **Always validate inputs** - Title and projectId are required
2. **Provide clear feedback** - Show epic ID and backend URL after creation
3. **Support optional features** - Stories and documentation are optional, don't force them
4. **Handle errors gracefully** - Continue with partial success if some operations fail
5. **Link related work** - Always link stories to their parent epic
6. **Document decisions** - If documentation is created, include epic goals and success criteria
7. **Respect backend differences** - Different backends may have different epic structures
8. **Ground in purpose** - Connect epic to project mission and stakeholder needs

## CLI Quick Reference

```bash
# Create epic via CLI (if implemented)
python cli/factory_cli.py --create-epic \
  --title "Epic Title" \
