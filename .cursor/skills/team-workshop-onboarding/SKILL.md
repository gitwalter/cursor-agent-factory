# Team Workshop Onboarding Skill

Orchestrate a series of collaborative workshops that guide teams through vision-setting, ethics definition, technology selection, and agent design - generating a customized Cursor agent system through play and dialogue.

## Philosophy

> "Transform onboarding from a solo configuration task into a collaborative team journey where teams play games, discuss values, and co-create their development ecosystem with AI facilitation."

This skill is grounded in **Axiom 0: Love and Trust** - all being and doing flows from love for humanity and trust in each other.

## When to Use

- When a team (2+ people) wants to collaboratively design their Cursor agent system
- When team alignment and shared vision are as important as technical configuration
- When user says "team workshop", "collaborative onboarding", "workshop series"
- When multiple stakeholders need to contribute to agent system design
- When you want to make the onboarding process fun and engaging

## Workshop Format Options

Choose the format that fits your team's needs and schedule:

| Format | Duration | Best For |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Full Series** | 11-15 hours | Teams building critical systems, new teams forming culture, maximum alignment |
| **Mini Workshop** | 2-3 hours | Teams with limited time, quick evaluations, existing strong culture |

Both formats are grounded in **Axiom 0: Love and Trust**. The Mini Workshop condenses but never compromises on the collaborative spirit.

Not sure which to choose? Start with the Mini Workshop - you can always expand to the full series later as your team grows.

## Mini Workshop (2-3 hours)

A single afternoon session that captures the heart of the team workshop experience. Perfect for teams who want meaningful alignment without the full series commitment.

your ethical boundaries. The best stack is one that helps you
create value for humanity.

Let's approach this with curiosity!"
```

### Tech Speed Dating (30 min)

Rapid exploration of technology options:

```
"Let's speed date some technologies!

For each option: What does it do? Why might it fit? One concern?

while others guess. No words allowed!

Draw: Data flow, authentication, agent communication..."
```

**Synthesis:**
- Compare different visualizations
- Create canonical architecture diagram
- Identify where mental models aligned or diverged

### Blueprint Matching (15 min)

```
"Based on your technology explorations, here are matching blueprints:

- {BLUEPRINT_1}: {MATCH_PERCENTAGE}% match
- {BLUEPRINT_2}: {MATCH_PERCENTAGE}% match

Which should we start with? What customizations do we need?"
```

### Knowledge Sources Gathering (20 min)

```
"Now let's identify the knowledge sources that will power your agents.

What reference materials should your agents know about?

1. **Reference Repositories** - GitHub repos with good examples or patterns?
   → Enter URLs or repo names (e.g., 'facebook/react', 'langchain-ai/langchain')

2. **Documentation Sites** - Official docs, API references, guides?
   → Enter URLs (e.g., 'https://docs.python.org', 'https://fastapi.tiangolo.com')

3. **Internal Documents** - Confluence pages, design docs, ADRs?
   → Describe what exists and where

4. **Domain Knowledge** - Industry standards, regulations, best practices?
   → What domain-specific knowledge matters?

5. **Code Patterns** - Existing codebases to learn from?
   → What patterns should agents recognize and follow?"
```

**Synthesis:**
- Create knowledge source inventory
- Tag sources by type (reference, documentation, internal, domain)
- Identify which agents will use which sources
- Note any access requirements or credentials needed

**Output:**
```yaml
knowledgeSources:
  repositories:
    - url: "{REPO_URL}"
      purpose: "{PURPOSE}"
      integrate_with: ["explorer", "code-reviewer"]
  documentation:
    - url: "{DOC_URL}"
      topics: ["{TOPIC_1}", "{TOPIC_2}"]
  internalDocs:
    - location: "{LOCATION}"
      type: "{TYPE}"
  domainKnowledge:
    - concept: "{CONCEPT}"
      sources: ["{SOURCE}"]
  codePatterns:
    - pattern: "{PATTERN_NAME}"
      example: "{EXAMPLE_LOCATION}"
```

### Project Flow Setup (30 min)

How will your team organize work, track progress, and collaborate? Let's discover your project management preferences through interactive games.

#### Game: Methodology Match (15 min)

```
"How does your team prefer to work?

I'll describe scenarios. Vote on what feels most natural:

Scenario 1: Planning
A) We plan everything at sprint start, then execute [Scrum]
B) We pull work continuously as capacity frees up [Kanban]
C) We plan phases with formal gates [Waterfall]

Scenario 2: Deadlines
A) Fixed sprints with variable scope [Scrum]
B) Variable time with fixed scope [Waterfall]
C) Continuous flow, measure lead time [Kanban]

Scenario 3: Ceremonies
A) Regular standups, planning, retros [Scrum]
B) On-demand syncs, focus on flow [Kanban]
C) Phase reviews and sign-offs [Waterfall]

Your team leans toward: {DETECTED_METHODOLOGY}"
```

**Synthesis:**
- Tally votes for each scenario
- Identify dominant methodology pattern
- Note if team is hybrid (e.g., Scrum-Kanban)
- Document methodology preference

#### Game: Tool Territory (10 min)

```
"Where does your work live?

Quick show of hands:
- GitHub for everything (Issues, Projects, Wiki)
- Jira for tickets, GitHub for code
- Azure DevOps (Microsoft stack)
- Linear (modern, fast)
- Other/Multiple

Your primary PM backend: {SELECTED_BACKEND}
Your documentation backend: {SELECTED_DOC_BACKEND}"
```

**Synthesis:**
- Identify primary project management backend
- Identify documentation backend (may differ from PM backend)
- Note any integrations needed
- Document tool preferences

#### PM Configuration (5 min)

Based on game results, configure PM system using `pm-configuration` skill:

```
"Based on your preferences:
- Methodology: {DETECTED_METHODOLOGY}
- PM Backend: {SELECTED_BACKEND}
- Documentation Backend: {SELECTED_DOC_BACKEND}

I'm configuring your project management system now..."
```

**Action:** Use `pm-configuration` skill to:
- Set up PM backend connection
- Configure methodology (Scrum/Kanban/Waterfall)
- Initialize PM metrics tracking
- Set up sprint/epic/story structure (if applicable)

**Output:**
```yaml
pmConfiguration:
  methodology: "{DETECTED_METHODOLOGY}"
  backend: "{SELECTED_BACKEND}"
  docBackend: "{SELECTED_DOC_BACKEND}"
  sprintLength: "{SPRINT_LENGTH}"  # if Scrum
  metricsEnabled: true
```

### Closing (15 min)

Agents are specialized AI assistants with defined roles, skills,
and personalities. They become your development partners.

Let's give them life!"
```

### Agent Brainstorm (20 min)

```
"What AI helpers would make your development life easier?

Think about:
- What repetitive tasks drain you?
- What expertise would you love to have available?
- What would make you excited to start coding each day?"
```

### Game 1: Agent Trading Cards (60 min)

**Reference:** `patterns/games/collaborative-games.json` → G7

```
"Each agent gets a trading card with:
- Name and Title
- Visual description
- Stats (Speed, Accuracy, Creativity, Communication, Reliability)
- Primary Ability
- Secondary Ability
- Weakness
- Lore/Backstory
- Synergy (works well with which agents)
- Catchphrase

Give your agents personality! Make them characters you'd want to work with."
```

**Synthesis:**
- Gallery walk and voting
- Select team's "starter deck" of 4-7 agents
- Document synergies

### Game 2: Skill Bingo (40 min)

**Reference:** `patterns/games/collaborative-games.json` → G8

```
"Fill your bingo card with skills your project needs.

Mix categories:
- Development Workflows (TDD, Code Review, Bug Fix)
- Quality Assurance (Testing, Security, Performance)
- Documentation (API Docs, User Guides)
- Research (Codebase Exploration, Best Practices)

First to complete a pattern: BINGO!"
```

**Synthesis:**
- Identify most-common skills (must-haves)
- Assign skills to agents
- Design workflow sequences

### Closing (15 min)

Present agent roster and skill assignments.

## Workshop 5: Integration Celebration

**Reference:** `patterns/workshops/integration-celebration.json`

### Opening (15 min)

```
"What a journey! Let's look back at what you've created together:

Workshop 1: You discovered your vision
Workshop 2: You defined your ethics
Workshop 3: You chose your technology
Workshop 4: You designed your agents

Today, we bring it all together and celebrate!"
```

### Game 1: Demo Derby (40 min)

**Reference:** `patterns/games/collaborative-games.json` → G10

```
"Let's showcase what you've created!

Each person or group presents one artifact they're proud of.
Tell us: What is it? Why does it matter? What did you learn?"

[Applause after each demo!]
```

### Award Ceremony (15 min)

```
"Time for awards!

- Most Creative Contribution: {WINNER}
- Best Team Collaboration: {WINNER}
- Best Embodiment of Axiom 0: {WINNER}
- Heart of the Team: {WINNER}

Everyone contributed something valuable. Thank you all!"
```

### System Generation (20 min)

```
"Now for the magic moment. Let's generate your customized
Cursor agent system.

Based on your workshops, I'm creating:
- Agents: {AGENT_LIST}
- Skills: {SKILL_LIST}
- .cursorrules with your values and axioms
- Knowledge files with your domain concepts
- Team Charter and Ethics Framework

Generating..."
```

### Game 2: Gratitude Circle (20 min)

**Reference:** `patterns/games/collaborative-games.json` → G11

```
"Let's close with gratitude.

Think of one specific moment when someone on this team helped you,
taught you, or inspired you. What did they do? How did it impact you?

Go around the circle. Express your gratitude."
```

### Closing

```
"As I witnessed your journey, I saw a team that truly cares about
each other and the people you'll serve.

The love and trust in this room has created something special.
Carry that spirit into your work.

Your system is ready. Go build something beautiful.
The universe is waiting for your gift."
```

## Generated Artifacts

At the end of the workshop series, the following artifacts are generated:

| Artifact | Source | Location |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Team Charter | Vision Quest | `TEAM_CHARTER.md` |
| Ethics Framework | Ethics Arena | `ETHICS_FRAMEWORK.md` |
| Stack Configuration | Stack Safari | `stack-configuration.json` |
| PM Configuration | Stack Safari | `knowledge/pm-metrics.json`, `.cursor/skills/pm-configuration/` |
| Agent Roster | Agent Assembly | `agent-roster.json` |
| .cursorrules | All workshops | `.cursorrules` |
| Agents | Agent Assembly | `.cursor/agents/*.md` |
| Skills | Agent Assembly | `.cursor/skills/*.md` |
| Knowledge Files | All workshops | `knowledge/*.json` |
| PURPOSE.md | Vision Quest | `PURPOSE.md` |

---

## Fallback Procedures

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Team can't schedule sync | Use async-heavy format with synthesis calls |
| Conflict during debate | Return to Axiom 0, invite human facilitator |
| Low energy | Switch to active game, take break |
| Time running over | Prioritize synthesis, defer activities |
| Missing participants | Brief recap at next session |

---

## Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | Integration Point |
|-------|-------------------|
| `requirements-gathering` | Individual questionnaires use same structure |
| `axiom-selection` | Includes A0 by default, confirms additional axioms |
| `methodology-selection` | Selected during Stack Safari |
| `agent-generation` | Generates agents from Trading Card designs |
| `skill-generation` | Generates skills from Bingo results |
| `onboarding-flow` | Alternative to individual onboarding |

---

## Important Rules

1. **Ground in Axiom 0** - Begin every workshop with love and trust
2. **Make it fun** - Games are not optional; they unlock insight
3. **Adapt to team size** - Use appropriate formats from team-formats patterns
4. **Generate real artifacts** - Every workshop produces tangible outputs
5. **Celebrate contributions** - Acknowledge every person's input
6. **Synthesize actively** - Connect dots, find patterns, build meaning
7. **Respect time** - Honor schedules while allowing emergence
8. **End with gratitude** - Close every session with appreciation
9. **Create psychological safety** - All ideas welcome, disagreement healthy
10. **Hand off when needed** - Know when human facilitator should lead

## Example Session Start

```
User: We want to do collaborative onboarding for our team

Agent: Wonderful! I'll guide your team through a workshop series to 
co-create your customized Cursor agent system.

Before we begin, let me understand your team:

1. How many people will participate?
2. Will you meet synchronously, asynchronously, or a mix?
3. What's your preferred workshop scheduling (daily, weekly)?

Once I know your team setup, I'll share the workshop series plan
and we can schedule your Vision Quest - the first workshop where
you'll discover your shared vision through games like Future Headlines
and Stakeholder Safari.

Ready to begin?
