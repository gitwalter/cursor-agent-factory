# Wisdom Harvest Skill

A structured approach to capturing tacit knowledge, lessons learned, and team wisdom that goes beyond technical requirements to embed real human experience into agent systems.

## Philosophy

> "The best practices aren't in the documentation. They're in the heads of the people who've been in the trenches."

Wisdom Harvest recognizes that teams have invaluable knowledge that rarely gets written down - the workarounds, the gotchas, the "we learned this the hard way" insights. This skill extracts that wisdom and embeds it into the agent system.

## When to Use

- During any onboarding process (Express Lane, Team Huddle, Full Workshop)
- When enhancing an existing agent system
- After a project retrospective
- When onboarding new team members (capture outgoing knowledge)
- User mentions "capture knowledge", "lessons learned", "best practices"

## Question Categories

### Category 1: Strengths & Pride

Questions that surface what the team does well.

| # | Question | Purpose |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1 | What's one thing your team does that you're proud of? | Identify and preserve good practices |
| 2 | What's a process or habit that makes your team effective? | Capture workflow wisdom |
| 3 | What do people compliment your team on? | External validation of strengths |

### Category 2: Lessons Learned

Questions that surface hard-won knowledge.

| # | Question | Purpose |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1 | What's a mistake you've learned from that others should avoid? | Capture failure patterns |
| 2 | What do you wish you'd known when you started this type of project? | Surface onboarding wisdom |
| 3 | What's something that seems simple but is actually tricky? | Identify hidden complexity |

### Category 3: Quality Definition

Questions that surface what "good" means.

| # | Question | Purpose |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1 | What does "done well" look like for this project? | Define quality bar |
| 2 | What's non-negotiable for code quality? | Identify hard requirements |
| 3 | How do you know when something is ready for production? | Capture readiness criteria |

### Category 4: Domain Knowledge

Questions that surface domain-specific wisdom.

| # | Question | Purpose |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1 | What are the tricky parts of your domain that trip people up? | Capture domain gotchas |
| 2 | What terminology does your team use that outsiders might not know? | Build glossary |
| 3 | What business rules are not obvious from the code? | Surface hidden logic |

### Category 5: Tool & Process Wisdom

Questions that surface tooling and process insights.

| # | Question | Purpose |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1 | What tools or shortcuts make you more productive? | Capture efficiency tips |
| 2 | What's your debugging process when things go wrong? | Document troubleshooting |
| 3 | How do you handle releases or deployments? | Capture release wisdom |

## Integration with Agent Behavior

### How Agents Use Wisdom

The captured wisdom is referenced in agent skills:

```yaml
# In .cursorrules or agent definitions
wisdom_integration:
  - skill: code-reviewer
    uses:
      - lessonsLearned (check for known pitfalls)
      - qualityDefinition (apply quality bar)
      
  - skill: bugfix-workflow
    uses:
      - toolWisdom.debuggingProcess (follow team's debug approach)
      - domainKnowledge.gotchas (warn about known issues)
      
  - skill: grounding
    uses:
      - domainKnowledge.glossary (understand terminology)
      - domainKnowledge.hiddenRules (respect business rules)
```

### Example Agent Prompt Enhancement

When a wisdom file exists, agents can include it in their context:

```
You are a code reviewer for this team. They value:
- {lessonsLearned}
- {qualityDefinition}

Watch for these known issues:
- {domainKnowledge.gotchas}
```

## Facilitation Tips

### Getting Good Answers

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Be specific** | "What's a specific bug that taught you something?" |
| **Ask for stories** | "Tell me about a time when..." |
| **Probe deeper** | "Why is that important?" |
| **Validate** | "So if I understand, you're saying..." |

### Common Challenges

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Vague answers | "Can you give me a specific example?" |
| Too technical | "How would you explain this to a new team member?" |
| "We don't have any" | "What would you tell your past self?" |
| Silence | "Let's think about your last project. What went well?" |

### Making It Safe

```
There are no wrong answers here. This isn't a test.
I'm just trying to capture what makes your team unique.
```

---

## Wisdom Maintenance

### When to Update

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| After major incident | Add to lessonsLearned |
| After retrospective | Review and update all sections |
| New team member leaves | Capture their knowledge first |
| New domain discovery | Update domainKnowledge |
| New tool adoption | Update toolWisdom |

### Update Process

```
/skill wisdom-harvest --update
```

This presents the current wisdom and asks:
1. Anything to add?
2. Anything no longer relevant?
3. Any corrections?

## Example Session

**Facilitator:** Let's capture some wisdom. What's one thing your team does well that you're proud of?

**Team Member 1:** We always write tests first. It slows us down a bit initially but saves so much debugging time.

**Team Member 2:** Yeah, and we pair on anything complex. Two sets of eyes catch so many issues.

**Facilitator:** Great! I'm capturing both of those. Now, what's a mistake you've learned from?

**Team Member 1:** We once deployed a migration that couldn't be rolled back. The table was already in production with data. Now we always require rollback scripts.

**Facilitator:**

## Advanced: Wisdom from Documentation

If the team has existing documentation, the skill can extract wisdom from:
- README files
- CONTRIBUTING guides
- ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Post-mortem documents
- Runbooks

```
I found these documents. Would you like me to extract wisdom from them?
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- docs/RUNBOOK.md
- adr/001-database-choice.md
```
