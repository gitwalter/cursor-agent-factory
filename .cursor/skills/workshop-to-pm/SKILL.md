# Workshop to PM Skill

Converts team workshop outputs into structured project management artifacts, transforming collaborative insights into actionable work items that teams can track and execute.

## Philosophy

> Workshop insights become actionable work items.

Team workshops generate rich insights about vision, stakeholders, values, and workflows. These insights should flow seamlessly into project management systems where they become epics, stories, labels, and definitions of done. This skill bridges the gap between collaborative discovery and structured execution, ensuring that workshop outputs don't get lost but instead seed the PM system with meaningful, team-aligned work.

## When to Use

- After completing team workshops (especially Workshop 1: Vision Quest and Workshop 2: Ethics Arena)
- When epics/stories were discussed during workshops
- To seed the PM system with workshop outputs
- When transitioning from workshop phase to execution phase
- When user mentions "convert workshop outputs", "import workshop results", "seed PM system"
- After generating TEAM_CHARTER.md or ETHICS_FRAMEWORK.md

## Prerequisites

Before converting workshop outputs, ensure:

1. PM backend is configured (via `pm-configuration` skill)
2. Workshop artifacts exist (TEAM_CHARTER.md, ETHICS_FRAMEWORK.md, or equivalent)
3. Project ID is available in the configured PM backend
4. Backend credentials are valid and connection is working

## Process

### Step 1: Collect Workshop Outputs

Read from workshop artifacts and identify extractable content:

**Artifacts to Read:**

1. **TEAM_CHARTER.md** → Project mission and success criteria
   - Mission statement → Epic descriptions
   - Future Headlines → Epic titles
   - Stakeholder list → Labels/tags
   - Success criteria → Acceptance criteria

2. **Future Headlines** → Epic descriptions
   - Each headline becomes a potential epic
   - Extract themes and group related headlines

3. **Stakeholder Safari** → User personas for story templates
   - Stakeholder names → Labels/tags
   - Stakeholder needs → User story templates
   - Priority order → Label hierarchy

4. **ETHICS_FRAMEWORK.md** → Definition of Done items
   - Core values → Quality gates
   - Ethical boundaries → Definition of Done checklist
   - Decision-making principles → Story acceptance criteria

5. **Agent Assembly workflows** → Task templates
   - Agent roles → Story types
   - Workflow sequences → Task templates
   - Skill assignments → Story tags

**Collection Script:**

```
"I'll help you convert your workshop outputs into PM artifacts.

Let me scan your workshop artifacts:

📄 Reading TEAM_CHARTER.md...
   ✓ Found {N} Future Headlines
   ✓ Found {N} Stakeholders
   ✓ Found mission statement

📄 Reading ETHICS_FRAMEWORK.md...
   ✓ Found {N} core values
   ✓ Found {N} ethical boundaries
   ✓ Found decision-making principles

📄 Reading agent-roster.json...
   ✓ Found {N} agents
   ✓ Found {N} workflows

Would you like me to:
A) Convert all identified items
B) Review and select specific items
C) Customize the transformation rules

Which option do you prefer?"
```

**Validation:**

- Verify artifacts exist and are readable
- Check for required fields (mission, stakeholders, values)
- Identify any missing context that might affect transformation

### Step 2: Transform to PM Artifacts

Transform workshop outputs into PM system structures:

#### Transformation Rules

**For each Future Headline:**

```yaml
Workshop Output:
  headline: "Local news platform connects neighbors during crisis"
  
PM Artifact:
  type: epic
  title: "Local News Platform - Crisis Connection"
  description: "Build platform that connects neighbors during crisis events"
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Platform enables real-time neighbor communication"
    - "Crisis events trigger automatic connection flows"
    - "Users can find and help nearby neighbors"
  linked_stakeholders: ["local-residents", "crisis-responders"]
```

**For each Stakeholder:**

```yaml
Workshop Output:
  stakeholder:
    name: "Local Residents"
    priority: 1
    needs: ["real-time updates", "trusted information", "community connection"]
    
PM Artifact:
  type: label
  name: "stakeholder:local-residents"
  color: "#4A90E2"  # Primary stakeholder color
  description: "Primary stakeholder - local residents seeking community connection"
  
  user_story_template:
    as_a: "local resident"
    i_want: "{capability}"
    so_that: "I can {benefit}"
```

    - "Privacy: User data encrypted and consent obtained"
    - "Transparency: Data usage clearly documented"
    - "Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified"
    - "Ethical boundary: No user data sold"
    - "Ethical boundary: No hidden data usage"
  applies_to: ["all_stories", "all_epics"]
```

**For Agent Workflows:**

```yaml
Workshop Output:
  workflow:
    name: "Code Review Flow"
    agents: ["code-reviewer", "security-auditor"]
    steps: ["analyze", "review", "approve"]
    
PM Artifact:
  type: task_template
  name: "Code Review Task Template"
  description: "Standard code review workflow"
  tasks:
    - "Code Reviewer analyzes changes"
    - "Security Auditor checks vulnerabilities"
    - "Team lead approves"
  tags: ["code-review", "security"]
```

**Transformation Script:**

```

      "tags": ["{TAG_1}", "{TAG_2}"]
    }
  ],
  "projectId": "{PROJECT_ID}"
}
```

**Creation Script:**

```
"Creating artifacts in {BACKEND_NAME}...

📦 Creating epics...
   ✓ Created EPIC-{ID}: {TITLE}
   ✓ Created EPIC-{ID}: {TITLE}
   ...

🏷️ Creating labels...
   ✓ Created label: stakeholder:{NAME}
   ✓ Created label: stakeholder:{NAME}
   ...

✅ Creating Definition of Done...
   ✓ Created DoD checklist with {N} items

📋 Creating task templates...
   ✓ Created template: {TEMPLATE_NAME}
   ...

All artifacts created successfully!"
```

### Step 4: Generate Report

Output summary of created artifacts with links:

**Report Format:**

```
✅ Workshop outputs successfully converted to PM artifacts!

## Summary

**Epics Created:** {COUNT}
{EPIC_LIST_WITH_LINKS}

**Labels Created:** {COUNT}
{LABEL_LIST}

**Definition of Done:** {LINK}
- {CHECKLIST_ITEM_COUNT} items
- Applies to: All stories and epics

**Task Templates:** {COUNT}
{TEMPLATE_LIST}

## Links

**PM Backend:** {BACKEND_URL}
**Project:** {PROJECT_NAME} ({PROJECT_ID})

## Next Steps

1. **Review epics** - Verify epic titles and descriptions match your vision
2. **Add stories** - Break down epics into user stories
3. **Assign labels** - Use stakeholder labels when creating stories
4. **Plan sprint** - Use epics to organize sprint planning
5. **Apply DoD** - Ensure Definition of Done is used in all stories

## Mapping Reference

Workshop Output → PM Artifact:
- Future Headlines → Epics
- Stakeholders → Labels
- Ethics Framework → Definition of Done
- Agent Workflows → Task Templates

Your workshop insights are now actionable work items!
```

## Example Transformations

### Example 1: Vision Quest → Epics

**Workshop Output (TEAM_CHARTER.md):**

```markdown
## Vision Headlines

- "Community garden app helps urban residents grow food"
- "Neighborhood safety network reduces crime by 40%"

## Stakeholders (Priority Order)
1. Local Residents
2. Community Organizers
3. City Officials
```

**Transformed PM Artifacts:**

```yaml
Epics:
  - id: EPIC-101
    title: "Local News Platform - Crisis Connection"
    description: "Build platform that connects neighbors during crisis events"
    labels: ["stakeholder:local-residents", "stakeholder:community-organizers"]
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "Platform enables real-time neighbor communication"
      - "Crisis events trigger automatic connection flows"
  
  - id: EPIC-102
    title: "Community Garden App"
    description: "Help urban residents grow food through community gardens"
    labels: ["stakeholder:local-residents"]
  
  - id: EPIC-103
    title: "Neighborhood Safety Network"
    description: "Reduce crime by 40% through neighborhood safety network"

- We will never: Exclude users due to accessibility barriers

## Decision-Making Principles
- When facing dilemmas about data, we prioritize user privacy
- All features must be accessible to users with disabilities
```

**Transformed PM Artifact:**

```yaml
Definition of Done:
  name: "Workshop Ethics Framework - Definition of Done"

## Integration with Other Skills

### Integration with team-workshop-onboarding Skill

When used after workshops:

```
"After completing your team workshops, I can convert the outputs
into PM artifacts:

- Future Headlines → Epics
- Stakeholders → Labels
- Ethics Framework → Definition of Done
- Agent Workflows → Task Templates

This seeds your PM system with meaningful, team-aligned work."
```

**Integration Points:**
- Runs after Workshop 1: Vision Quest (for epics and stakeholders)
- Runs after Workshop 2: Ethics Arena (for Definition of Done)
- Runs after Workshop 4: Agent Assembly (for task templates)
- Uses PM configuration from Workshop 3: Stack Safari

### Integration with pm-configuration Skill

PM configuration must exist:

```
"Before converting workshop outputs, ensure PM backend is configured.
If not configured, I'll guide you through pm-configuration first."
```

**Integration Points:**
- Requires PM backend configuration
- Uses project ID from PM configuration
- Respects backend type for transformation rules

### Integration with create-epic Skill

Epic creation uses same backend operations:

```
"When creating epics from Future Headlines, I use the same
create-epic operations, ensuring consistency across your PM system."
```

**Integration Points:**
- Uses same `createEpic` backend operation
- Follows same epic structure and validation
- Links epics to stakeholders via labels

### Integration with plan-sprint Skill

Converted epics inform sprint planning:

```
"After converting workshop outputs, you can use plan-sprint to:
1. Pull epics into sprints
2. Break epics into stories
3. Track epic progress across sprints"
```

**Integration Points:**
- Epics created here appear in sprint planning
- Stakeholder labels help prioritize stories
- Definition of Done applies to all sprint work

## Important Rules

1. **Preserve workshop intent** - Transformations should maintain the spirit and meaning of workshop outputs
2. **Validate before creating** - Check that artifacts exist and are readable before transformation
3. **Handle missing data gracefully** - If required fields are missing, ask user or use defaults
4. **Respect backend differences** - Different backends have different structures; adapt accordingly
5. **Link related artifacts** - Always link epics to stakeholder labels, stories to epics
6. **Provide clear feedback** - Show what was created, with links and summaries
7. **Allow customization** - Let users review and modify transformations before creating
8. **Support partial success** - If some artifacts fail to create, continue with others
9. **Document transformations** - Keep mapping of workshop output → PM artifact for reference
10. **Ground in purpose** - Connect all artifacts to project mission and stakeholder needs
