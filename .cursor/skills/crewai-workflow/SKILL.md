# CrewAI Workflow Skill

Build production-ready multi-agent workflows using CrewAI best practices.

## When to Use

- Building multi-agent systems with specialized roles
- Need hierarchical or sequential task execution
- Want to implement Flows for state management
- Building pipelines that chain multiple crews

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install crewai crewai-tools
```

## Process

### Step 1: Define Agents

Create specialized agents with clear roles:

```python
from crewai import Agent

researcher = Agent(
    role='Research Analyst',
    goal='Find accurate information on topics',
    backstory='Expert researcher with attention to detail',
    verbose=True,
    memory=True,
    max_iter=3
)

writer = Agent(
    role='Content Writer',
    goal='Create engaging content from research',
    backstory='Skilled writer who transforms data into stories',
    verbose=True
)
```

### Step 2: Define Tasks

Create tasks with clear expected outputs:

```python
from crewai import Task

research_task = Task(
    description='Research the topic: {topic}',
    agent=researcher,
    expected_output='Comprehensive research report with key findings'
)

writing_task = Task(
    description='Write an article based on research',
    agent=writer,
    expected_output='Engaging article in markdown format',
    context=[research_task]  # Depends on research
)
```

### Step 3: Create Crew

Assemble agents and tasks into a crew:

```python
from crewai import Crew, Process

crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[research_task, writing_task],
    process=Process.sequential,
    verbose=True,
    memory=True
)

result = crew.kickoff(inputs={"topic": "AI Agents"})
print(result.raw)
```

### Step 4: Add Flows (Optional)

For complex state management:

```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start

class MyFlow(Flow):
    @start()
    def begin(self):
        return crew.kickoff(inputs={"topic": "AI"})
    
    @listen(begin)
    def process_result(self, result):
        return result.raw

flow = MyFlow()
final_result = flow.kickoff()
```

## What Gets Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `agents/` | Agent definitions with roles |
| `tasks/` | Task definitions with dependencies |
| `crews/` | Crew configurations |
| `flows/` | Flow orchestrations (optional) |

## Process Types

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `Process.sequential` | Tasks run one after another |
| `Process.hierarchical` | Manager delegates to workers |

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Roles**: Each agent should have ONE clear responsibility
2. **Detailed Backstories**: Guide agent behavior with context
3. **Set max_iter**: Prevent infinite loops (typically 3-5)
4. **Use Context**: Chain tasks with the `context` parameter
5. **Enable Memory**: Use `memory=True` for better context

## Common Patterns

### Research → Write → Review Pipeline

```python
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer, reviewer],
    tasks=[research_task, write_task, review_task],
    process=Process.sequential
)
```

### Hierarchical with Manager

```python
crew = Crew(
    agents=[manager, worker1, worker2],
    tasks=[complex_task],
    process=Process.hierarchical,
    manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-4')
)
```

## Fallback Procedures

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Agent loops infinitely | Set `max_iter=3` |
| Wrong task order | Use `context` parameter |
| Tool failures | Add error handling in tools |
| LLM errors | Use `max_retry_limit` |
