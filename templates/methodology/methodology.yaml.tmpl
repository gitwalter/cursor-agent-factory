# Usage Notes
#
# This methodology configuration is used by agents to understand:
# 1. How work should be organized and coordinated
# 2. What ceremonies and processes to follow
# 3. How to measure progress and quality
#
# To modify this methodology:
# 1. Review changes against axiom alignment
# 2. Update affected ceremonies and metrics
# 3. Communicate changes to team
# 4. Monitor impact on quality gates
