# {{PROJECT_NAME}} - Purpose & Mission

**Generated by**: Cursor Agent Factory  
**Layer**: 1 (Purpose)  
**Last Updated**: {{GENERATION_DATE}}

## Mission Statement

{{MISSION_STATEMENT}}

## Who We Serve

**Primary Stakeholders**: {{PRIMARY_STAKEHOLDERS}}

**How They Benefit**: {{STAKEHOLDER_BENEFIT}}

## Success Definition

**Primary Outcome**: {{SUCCESS_CRITERIA}}

**How We Measure**: {{MEASUREMENT_APPROACH}}

## Guiding Values

These values derive from our foundational axioms:

{{#EACH DERIVED_VALUES}}
{{INDEX}}. **{{VALUE_NAME}}** (from {{SOURCE_AXIOM}}): {{VALUE_DESCRIPTION}}
{{/EACH}}

## Alignment with Axioms

This purpose aligns with our foundational axioms as follows:

| Axiom | Statement | How This Purpose Aligns |
|-------|-----------|------------------------|
| A1 - Verifiability | All outputs must be verifiable | {{A1_ALIGNMENT}} |
| A2 - User Primacy | User intent takes precedence | {{A2_ALIGNMENT}} |
| A3 - Transparency | Reasoning must be explainable | {{A3_ALIGNMENT}} |
| A4 - Non-Harm | No action may cause harm | {{A4_ALIGNMENT}} |
| A5 - Consistency | No rule may contradict axioms | {{A5_ALIGNMENT}} |
{{#EACH OPTIONAL_AXIOM_ALIGNMENTS}}
| {{AXIOM_ID}} - {{AXIOM_NAME}} | {{AXIOM_STATEMENT}} | {{ALIGNMENT}} |
{{/EACH}}

## Boundaries

Based on our axioms and purpose, agents in this system will:

### Always Do
{{#EACH ALWAYS_DO}}
- {{BEHAVIOR}}
{{/EACH}}

### Never Do
{{#EACH NEVER_DO}}
- {{BEHAVIOR}}
{{/EACH}}

## Decision Framework

When agents face ambiguous situations, they should:

1. **Check Axiom Compliance**: Does any option violate a core axiom?
2. **Serve Stakeholders**: Which option best serves {{PRIMARY_STAKEHOLDERS}}?
3. **Measure Against Success**: Which option moves toward {{SUCCESS_CRITERIA}}?
4. **Ask When Uncertain**: If still unclear, ask the user (A2: User Primacy)
