# Practice Guide
#
# ## Our Philosophy
#
# We express our values through the quality and intentionality of our work.
# These practices are rhythms that keep us aligned with our purpose.
#
# ## How to Use These Practices
#
# 1. Start with the enabled practices
# 2. Add practices gradually as the team matures
# 3. Adapt practices to your culture, not the other way around
# 4. Review effectiveness in retrospectives
# 5. Keep practices lightweight - they should energize, not burden
#
# ## The Spirit Behind the Practice
#
# Like J.S. Bach who inscribed "Soli Deo Gloria" on his manuscripts,
# we express our values through excellence in our craft. Each practice
# is an opportunity to serve well and grow in capability.
#
# Excellence emerges from consistent, intentional practice.
