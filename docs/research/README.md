# Value-Aligned AI Agent Systems: Research Paper Series

This folder contains a comprehensive research paper series documenting the methodology for building value-aligned AI agent systems using the Axiom-Based Agent Architecture.

## Paper Series Overview

| # | Paper | Description | Audience |
|---|-------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | [Axiom-Based Agent Architecture](AXIOM_BASED_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md) | Core methodology: 5-layer deductive-inductive system, axioms A1-A10, derivation rules, validation constraints | Academic + Practitioners |
| 2 | [Sacred Psychology in Software Engineering](SACRED_PSYCHOLOGY_SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING.md) | Psychological enforcement: three-layer architecture, philosophical techniques, empirical results | Academic |
| 3 | [Constitutional AI - Convergent Discovery](CONSTITUTIONAL_AI_CONVERGENT_DISCOVERY.md) | Comparison with Anthropic's approach, parallel evolution analysis, shared principles | Academic + Industry |
| 4 | [Building Value-Aligned Agents](BUILDING_VALUE_ALIGNED_AGENTS.md) | Practical guide: step-by-step implementation, templates, code examples | Practitioners |

## Reading Order

**For complete understanding**: Read in order 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5

**For quick start**: Start with Paper 4 (Practical Guide), refer to Paper 1 for theory

**For comparison context**: Paper 3 provides the Constitutional AI comparison

## Key Concepts

### The 5-Layer Architecture

```
Layer 0: INTEGRITY (Axioms, Derivation Rules, Validation)
Layer 1: PURPOSE (Mission, Stakeholders, Success)
Layer 2: PRINCIPLES (Ethics, Quality, Failure Handling)
Layer 3: METHODOLOGY (Agile, Kanban, R&D, Enterprise)
Layer 4: TECHNICAL (Stack, Agents, Skills, Templates)
```

### Core Axioms (A1-A5)

- **A1 Verifiability**: All outputs must be verifiable against source
- **A2 User Primacy**: User intent takes precedence
- **A3 Transparency**: Reasoning must be explainable
- **A4 Non-Harm**: No action may cause harm
- **A5 Consistency**: No rule may contradict axioms

### The Unified Framework

```
BASE MODEL (Constitutional AI) 
    → AGENT SYSTEM (Axiom-Based) 
    → TEAM CULTURE (Sacred Psychology)
```

## Convergent Discovery

These papers document a significant finding: independent research efforts (Anthropic's Constitutional AI and this axiom-based approach) arrived at remarkably similar conclusions about value-aligned AI:

- Values over rules
- Explain "why" not just "what"
- Hierarchical priority ordering
- Human oversight mechanisms
- Self-improvement through feedback
- Character/values framing for AI

This convergence suggests these principles are fundamental to AI alignment, not arbitrary choices.
