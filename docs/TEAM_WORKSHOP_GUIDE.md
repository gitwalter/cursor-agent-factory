### Detailed Facilitation Guide

#### Opening (15 min)

**AI Script:**
```
Welcome to your Vision Quest!

Before we dive in, let's ground ourselves in Axiom 0:
"All being and doing is grounded in love and trust."

This means we assume positive intent, create from care rather than fear,
and trust each other to contribute their best.

Let's go around the room. Share your name and one hope you have 
for this project - what impact do you dream of making?
```

**Facilitator Tips:**
- Ensure everyone shares (round-robin)
- Capture hopes visually on a board
- Note themes as they emerge

#### Game 1: Future Headlines (35 min)

**Setup (2 min):**
```
Imagine it's 5 years from now. Your project has succeeded beyond 
your wildest dreams. Major publications are writing about it.

You have 10 minutes to write 3-5 newspaper headlines about your success.
Be bold! There are no wrong answers here.
```

**Individual Writing (8-10 min):**
- Play upbeat background music
- No talking during this phase
- Encourage quantity over quality

**Sharing (10-15 min):**
- Each person shares their favorite 1-2 headlines
- No discussion yet - just listening
- Encourage "ooh" and "aah" reactions

**Voting (3 min):**
- 3 votes per person
- Place on headlines that inspire you most
- Can vote for your own if genuinely inspiring

**Synthesis (5 min):**
```
What themes appear across our top headlines?
Who are the heroes in these stories?
What emotions do the best headlines evoke?
```

**Adaptation by Team Size:**
- **Small (2-5):** Each person writes 3-5 headlines, all share
- **Medium (6-12):** Pairs write together, share with full group
- **Large (13+):** Groups of 4-5, representatives present to plenary

#### Game 2: Stakeholder Safari (50 min)

**Stakeholder Brainstorm (5 min):**
```
Who are all the people affected by your project?
- Users and customers
- Team members
- Partners and vendors
- Affected communities
- Future generations
- Who else?
```

**Role Assignment (3 min):**
- Each person draws or chooses a stakeholder
- Encourage choosing stakeholders different from yourself

**Character Development (5 min):**
```
Get into character:
- What's this person's name?
- What's their daily life like?
- What keeps them up at night?
- What do they hope for?
```

**Interviews (20 min):**

AI prompts each "stakeholder":
```
As [name], describe a typical frustrating day before our project exists.
What would make you trust a new solution in this space?
If this project succeeds wildly, how is your Tuesday different?
What's the thing no one asks you about, but really matters to you?
```

**Synthesis (10 min):**
```
Each stakeholder shares their biggest hope and biggest fear.
Who are our primary beneficiaries?
Where do stakeholder needs conflict?
```

#### Mission Crystallization (45 min) - Human Facilitated

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. "Based on our headlines and safari, what is the ONE sentence that captures WHY this project should exist?"
2. "Who are our primary stakeholders? In what order do we serve them?"
3. "How will we know if we've succeeded? What's the single most important outcome?"

**Facilitator Tips:**
- Capture key points on visible board
- Push for specificity over generality
- Note disagreements for later resolution
- Aim for consensus, not unanimity

#### Closing (15 min)

**Present Draft Team Charter:**
```markdown
# TEAM_CHARTER.md

## Mission
[Synthesized mission statement]

## Vision Headlines
1. [Top headline 1]
2. [Top headline 2]
3. [Top headline 3]

## Workshop 2: Ethics Arena

### Purpose
Establish the team's ethical framework, boundaries, and decision-making principles through structured debate and competitive value revelation.

### Duration
2 hours

### Materials Needed
- Dilemma scenario cards
- Value cards for auction (10-15 values)
- Bidding tokens (100 per participant/team)
- Timer
- Debate scoring board (optional)

### Agenda

| Time | Phase | Facilitator | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 0:00 | Opening | AI | Review journey, ethics introduction |
| 0:10 | Dilemma Duel | Human | Structured ethical debates |
| 1:00 | Value Auction | AI | Bid on values with limited points |
| 1:35 | Boundary Setting | Human | Define what we will NEVER do |
| 1:55 | Closing | AI | Present Ethics Framework |

### Detailed Facilitation Guide

#### Opening (10 min)

**AI Script:**
```
Welcome back! Today we explore the values that will guide 
how you pursue your vision.

Remember Axiom 0: Ethics flows from love. We don't follow rules 
because we fear punishment - we act ethically because we love 
humanity and want to serve well.

Today's games will challenge you. There are no perfect answers - 
only opportunities to discover what you truly value.
```

#### Game 1: Dilemma Duel (50 min)

**Setup:**
Present 2-3 dilemmas relevant to the team's domain. Prepare these in advance or use the examples below.

**Sample Dilemmas:**

1. **Speed vs. Security**
   > You discover a critical bug affecting 10% of users. You can ship a quick fix in 2 hours (some risk of new bugs) or a thorough fix in 2 weeks (users suffer longer but fix is bulletproof).
   - Option A: Ship the quick fix now
   - Option B: Take time for the thorough fix

2. **Transparency vs. Privacy**
   > Your AI makes decisions that affect users. Full transparency would help users understand but expose proprietary logic. Opacity protects IP but feels manipulative.
   - Option A: Full transparency
   - Option B: Protect proprietary logic

3. **User Request vs. User Wellbeing**
   > Users request a feature giving them more control, but your data suggests it leads to worse outcomes. They want autonomy; you have information they don't.
   - Option A: Give users the control they want
   - Option B: Protect users from potentially harmful choices

**Debate Structure (15 min per dilemma):**

1. Present dilemma (2 min)
2. Team splits by gut reaction (1 min)
3. Teams prepare arguments (5 min)
4. Structured debate:
   - Side A presents (2 min)
   - Side B responds (2 min)
   - Side B presents (2 min)
   - Side A responds (2 min)
5. Values extraction (5 min):
   ```
   What value was each side protecting?
   What principle could honor both concerns?
   How might this appear in our actual project?
   ```

**Team Size Adaptation:**
- **Small:** No team split - assign devil's advocate
- **Medium:** Full structured debate with teams
- **Large:** Tournament format with parallel debates

#### Game 2: Value Auction (35 min)

**Setup (8 min):**
```
You each have 100 points - your total investment capacity.
We'll auction these values. You cannot get more points.
This reveals what you truly prioritize.
```

**Sample Values to Auction:**
- User Privacy
- Performance Speed
- Code Elegance
- Accessibility
- Innovation
- Stability
- Developer Experience
- Time to Market
- Scalability
- Simplicity
- Transparency
- Security
- User Delight
- Maintainability
- Cost Efficiency

**Auction Rounds (20 min):**
- Start each value at 5 points
- Increment bids by 5
- "Going once, going twice, sold!"
- Winner explains why this value was worth the price

**Analysis (7 min):**
```
Which values sold highest? What does that reveal?
What was surprisingly cheap?
Where did stated preferences differ from bidding behavior?
```

**Team Size Adaptation:**
- **Small:** Individual bidding
- **Medium:** Teams bid together (must agree internally first)
- **Large:** Representatives bid, coached by groups via chat

#### Boundary Setting (20 min) - Human Facilitated

**Discussion Prompt:**
```
Based on our debates and auction, what should this team NEVER do?

Complete this sentence: 
"Even if it costs us the project, we will never..."
```

**Process:**
1. Individual brainstorm (3 min)
2. Share and cluster (10 min)
3. Vote on inclusion (3 min)
4. Document firm boundaries (4 min)

#### Closing (15 min)

**Present Draft Ethics Framework:**
```markdown
# ETHICS_FRAMEWORK.md

## Grounded in Axiom 0
All ethical decisions flow from love and trust.

## Core Values (Ranked by Auction Price)
1. [Value 1] - [Price] points
2. [Value 2] - [Price] points
3. [Value 3] - [Price] points

## Ethical Boundaries
- We will never: [Boundary 1]
- We will never: [Boundary 2]
- We will never: [Boundary 3]

## Decision-Making Principles
- When facing [dilemma type], we prioritize [principle]

## Utilitarian Check
For major decisions, ask:
- Who benefits? How many? How much?
- Are we optimizing for the greatest good?
```

## Troubleshooting

### Energy Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Low energy | Take break, switch to active game, stand up |
| Too much energy (chaotic) | Add structure, use round-robin |
| One person dominating | "Let's hear from others", structured turns |
| Silent participants | Direct invitation, written input option |

### Conflict

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Heated debate | Pause, return to Axiom 0, acknowledge emotions |
| Persistent disagreement | Find shared values, try voting, parking lot |
| Personal attacks | Stop immediately, reset ground rules |

### Time Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Running over | Prioritize synthesis, defer activities |
| Finishing early | Add reflection time, go deeper on key points |
| Participant late | Brief recap, catch up at break |

### Technical Issues (Virtual)

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Poor connection | Use chat, async follow-up |
| Tools not working | Backup to simpler tools (chat, doc) |
| Breakout room issues | Use main room with muting |
