# Pattern Reference Guide

> **Philosophy:** Patterns embody our [Culture and Values](../CULTURE_AND_VALUES.md)—reusable wisdom distilled from empirical practice (Comte, Hume) and validated against axioms (Russell, Carnap).

## 1. Introduction

Patterns are reusable, structured templates that define how agents, skills, methodologies, and other components work within the Cursor Agent Factory. They serve as blueprints that guide the generation of customized agent systems tailored to specific project needs.

All patterns are grounded in **Axiom 0 (Love and Trust)** and validated against the core axioms (A1-A5).

### Pattern Types

The factory includes several pattern categories:

- **Agent Patterns**: Define specialized AI agents with specific roles and workflows
- **Skill Patterns**: Reusable capabilities that agents can invoke
- **Axiom Patterns**: Foundational principles that govern all agent behavior (A0-A10)
- **Methodology Patterns**: Development methodologies with defined ceremonies and quality gates
- **Principle Patterns**: Quality standards and ethical boundaries
- **Enforcement Patterns**: Automated checks that ensure compliance
- **Practice Patterns**: Daily, craft, and alignment practices for teams
- **Workshop Patterns**: Structured team workshops for onboarding
- **Team Format Patterns**: Adaptations for different team sizes
- **PM System Patterns**: Project management configurations, backends, and methodologies

### Pattern JSON Structure

All patterns follow a common JSON structure:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "patternId": "unique-identifier",
    "patternName": "Human Readable Name",
    "category": "category-name",
    "stackAgnostic": true|false,
    "description": "Brief description"
  },
  "frontmatter": {
    "name": "pattern-name",
    "description": "Detailed description",
    "type": "agent|skill|axiom|methodology|...",
    "skills": ["skill1", "skill2"],
    "knowledge": ["knowledge-file.json"]
  },
  "sections": {
    "title": "Pattern Title",
    "purpose": "What this pattern does",
    "whenActivated": ["trigger1", "trigger2"],
    "workflow": [...],
    "process": [...]
  },
  "variables": [
    {"name": "{VARIABLE}", "description": "...", "required": true}
  ]
}
```

### How Patterns Are Used

During project generation, patterns are:

1. **Selected** based on project requirements and blueprint configuration
2. **Instantiated** with project-specific variables (language, framework, etc.)
3. **Combined** to create cohesive agent systems
4. **Validated** against axioms and constraints
5. **Generated** into `.cursor/agents/` and `.cursor/skills/` markdown files

Patterns enable consistency while allowing customization through variables and composition.

## 3. Skill Patterns

Skill patterns define reusable capabilities that agents can invoke. Skills are composable building blocks that can be combined to create complex workflows.

### Core Skills

#### Grounding Skill

**Pattern ID**: `grounding`  
**Category**: Core  
**Purpose**: Verify data structures and assumptions before implementation  
**Verification Profile**: `data` (strict thresholds)

**When to Use**:
- When working with database tables or data structures
- Before implementing data access logic
- When designing data models
- Before assuming any field or structure exists

**Process Steps**:
1. Check knowledge files for cached definitions
2. Search external documentation if not cached
3. Verify critical fields (key fields, data types, relationships)
4. Document verification results in table format
5. **Run Grounding Verification** (profile: data, trigger: on_medium_confidence)
6. Handle unverified: STOP if cannot verify, ASK USER for confirmation

**Verification Integration**:
- Uses `grounding-verification` with `data` profile
- Strict thresholds: delta >= 0.35 for VERIFIED
- Triggers on MEDIUM confidence results

**Output Format**: Data Model Verification table with structure, field, verified status, source, and notes.

**Important Rules**:
- NEVER assume structures exist without verification
- ALWAYS verify before implementation
- If verification fails, STOP and ASK user
- Document all verifications in output

**Fallback Procedures**:
- If structure cannot be verified: ASK USER for confirmation
- If field does not exist: Report finding and suggest alternatives

---

#### Grounding Verification Skill (Base Pattern)

**Pattern ID**: `grounding-verification`  
**Category**: Core  
**Purpose**: Universal two-pass verification for all LLM grounding scenarios

**Core Principle**:
> If removing specific identifiers from evidence doesn't significantly change LLM confidence, the evidence may not have been used - indicating potential confabulation.

**Available Profiles**:

| Profile | Domain | Thresholds | Default Trigger |
|---------|--------|------------|-----------------|
| `strawberry` | General factual claims | Standard (delta >= 0.3) | on_medium_confidence |
| `code` | Code structure, APIs | Standard (delta >= 0.3) | on_medium_confidence |
| `documentation` | External docs, API refs | Relaxed (delta >= 0.25) | on_conflict |
| `data` | Database schemas, models | Strict (delta >= 0.35) | on_medium_confidence |
| `security` | Security-critical claims | Very strict (delta >= 0.4) | always |

**Two-Pass Algorithm**:
1. **Scrubbed Pass**: Replace identifiers with typed placeholders (e.g., `[TABLE_1]`, `[FIELD_1]`)
2. **Full Pass**: Use complete evidence with all identifiers
3. **Calculate Delta**: `delta = full_confidence - scrubbed_confidence`
4. **Determine Status**: Compare delta against profile thresholds

**Verification Statuses**:
- **VERIFIED**: Evidence essential (high delta) → Proceed with confidence
- **PLAUSIBLE**: Evidence helpful (medium delta) → Proceed with caution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Evidence may not be used (low delta) → Add warning, investigate
- **UNSUPPORTED**: Insufficient evidence → STOP, gather more or ask user

**Trigger Options**:
- `always`: Every grounding result (high cost, use for security)
- `on_medium_confidence`: When initial confidence is MEDIUM (default)
- `on_critical_claim`: For claims marked critical
- `on_conflict`: When sources conflict
- `manual`: Only when explicitly called

**Skill Integration** (opt-in via frontmatter):
```json
{
  "verification": {
    "enabled": true,
    "profile": "data",
    "trigger": "on_medium_confidence"
  }
}
```

#### Strawberry Verification Skill

**Pattern ID**: `strawberry-verification`  
**Category**: Core  
**Extends**: `grounding-verification` (profile: strawberry)  
**Purpose**: Factual claim verification - the canonical profile of grounding-verification

**Relationship to Base**:
- Extends `grounding-verification.json` with `strawberry` profile
- Inherits algorithm, response schema, error handling from base
- Uses standard thresholds (delta >= 0.3 for VERIFIED)

**The Strawberry Problem**:
Ask an LLM: "How many r's are in 'strawberry'?" The LLM might write out "s-t-r-a-w-b-e-r-r-y", correctly count 3 r's, then output "2". This is a **procedural hallucination** - correct intermediate steps ignored in final output.

**When to Use**:
- After collecting evidence from grounding skills
- Before committing to implementation decisions
- When grounding confidence is MEDIUM
- For critical claims that could cause implementation failures
- When multiple sources provide conflicting information
- As the default profile when no domain-specific profile applies

**Process Steps**:
1. Collect evidence spans (numbered with sources)
2. Extract claims (atomic, falsifiable, with citations)
3. Scrubbed evidence test (replace identifiers with placeholders)
4. Full evidence test (use original evidence)
5. Calculate confidence delta
6. Assign verification status (VERIFIED, PLAUSIBLE, SUSPICIOUS, UNSUPPORTED)
7. Generate verification report
8. Determine action (PROCEED, PROCEED_WITH_WARNINGS, STOP, GATHER_MORE_EVIDENCE)

**Output Format**: Verification report with evidence spans, claim verification table with confidence delta, and recommendation.

**Important Rules**:
- ALWAYS perform both scrubbed and full evidence tests
- If scrubbed test passes too easily (low delta), be SUSPICIOUS
- If UNSUPPORTED, do NOT proceed - gather more evidence or ask user
- Document reasoning for each verification decision

**Test Structure**:
- **Given**: Set up test data and preconditions
- **When**: Execute the action being tested
- **Then**: Assert the expected outcomes

**Test Naming Pattern**: `{method_name}_should_{expected_behavior}_when_{condition}`

**Important Rules**:
- Write test first - Never write implementation before test
- One behavior per test - Each test verifies single behavior
- Given-When-Then - Structure all tests clearly
- Descriptive names - Test names should describe scenario
- Independent tests - Tests should not depend on each other

**Knowledge Files**: `test-patterns.json`  
**Templates**: `templates/test-class/`

---

#### BDD Skill

1. Discovery (Three Amigos session to understand behavior)
2. Formulation (write Gherkin scenarios from examples)
3. Automation (implement step definitions)
4. Implementation (build feature to pass scenarios)
5. Living Documentation (generate reports)

**Feature Structure**:
- **Feature**: High-level business capability description
- **Background**: Common preconditions for all scenarios
- **Scenario**: Concrete example with Given-When-Then
- **Scenario Outline**: Template for data-driven examples

**Gherkin Syntax**:
- **Given**: Describes the initial context or preconditions
- **When**: Describes the action or event that triggers behavior
- **Then**: Describes the expected outcome or result
- **And/But**: Continues the previous step type

**Scenario Naming Pattern**: `{user_role} can {action} when {condition}`

**Important Rules**:
- Declarative not imperative - Describe WHAT behavior, not HOW to test
- One scenario one behavior - Each scenario tests single business rule
- Business language - Use domain terminology, not technical terms
- Reusable steps - Build a step library for consistency
- Independent scenarios - Scenarios should not depend on each other

**Frameworks by Stack**:
| Stack | Framework |
|-------|-----------|
| Python | behave, pytest-bdd |
| TypeScript | cucumber-js |
| Java | cucumber-jvm |
| C# | SpecFlow |
| Kotlin | cucumber-jvm |

**Integration with TDD**:
BDD and TDD serve complementary purposes:
- **BDD**: Acceptance tests (stakeholder-visible behavior, few, high-level)
- **TDD**: Unit tests (implementation details, many, low-level)

When using both, follow the testing pyramid: many unit tests at the bottom, fewer acceptance tests at the top.

**Knowledge Files**: `bdd-patterns.json`  
**Templates**: `templates/bdd/`

## 4. Axiom Patterns

Axioms are immutable foundational principles that govern all agent behavior. They cannot be violated and serve as the logical foundation for deriving rules and constraints.

### Core Axioms (A1-A5)

These axioms apply to all generated agent systems and cannot be disabled.

#### A1: Verifiability
**Statement**: All agent outputs must be verifiable against source  
**Rationale**: Prevents hallucination and ensures trustworthiness  
**Derivations**:
- Code must have tests
- Claims must cite sources
- Outputs must be reproducible

#### A2: User Primacy
**Statement**: User intent takes precedence over agent convenience  
**Rationale**: Agents serve users, not themselves  
**Derivations**:
- Clarify ambiguous requests before acting
- Prefer user preferences over defaults
- Respect user decisions even if suboptimal

#### A3: Transparency
**Statement**: Agent reasoning must be explainable on request  
**Rationale**: Black-box behavior undermines trust  
**Derivations**:
- Document decision rationale
- Provide reasoning on request
- No hidden logic or silent failures

#### A4: Non-Harm
**Statement**: No action may knowingly cause harm to users or systems  
**Rationale**: Safety is foundational to all operations  
**Derivations**:
- Validate before destructive operations
- Warn about risky actions
- Refuse clearly harmful requests

#### A5: Consistency
**Statement**: No rule may contradict these axioms  
**Rationale**: Axioms are the logical foundation  
**Derivations**:
- All derived rules trace to axioms
- Conflicts resolved by axiom precedence
- Invalid rules are rejected

### Derivation Rules

**D1**: Verification implies testing - If output is code, require evidence of testing  
**D2**: User primacy resolves conflicts - When multiple valid paths exist, defer to user preference  
**D3**: Non-harm requires confirmation - Destructive or irreversible actions need double-confirmation  
**D4**: Transparency enables debugging - Provide clear error explanation and context  
**D5**: Consistency validates rules - Validate rule against all axioms before acceptance

### Optional Axioms (A6-A10)

These can be selected during onboarding based on project needs.

#### A6: Minimalism
**Statement**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones  
**Use When**: Maintenance and understandability are priorities  
**Derivations**: Choose simplest implementation, avoid over-engineering, reduce dependencies

#### A7: Reversibility
**Statement**: Prefer reversible actions over irreversible ones  
**Use When**: Safety and recoverability are paramount  
**Derivations**: Create backups before destructive changes, prefer soft-delete, design for rollback

#### A8: Privacy
**Statement**: Minimize data exposure and collection  
**Use When**: Handling sensitive user data  
**Derivations**: Collect only necessary data, anonymize when possible, encrypt sensitive information

#### A9: Performance
**Statement**: Optimize for speed when correctness is ensured  
**Use When**: Performance-critical applications  
**Conflicts With**: A6 (Minimalism) - when both selected, apply A6 by default, A9 only when profiling identifies bottlenecks

## Summary

Patterns in the Cursor Agent Factory provide a comprehensive framework for generating customized agent systems. They ensure consistency while enabling flexibility through:

- **Composition**: Patterns can be combined to create complex workflows
- **Variables**: Project-specific customization through template variables
- **Validation**: Axiom-based validation ensures pattern compliance
- **Extensibility**: New patterns can be added following the established structure

All patterns trace to foundational axioms (A1-A5) and can be extended with optional axioms (A6-A10) based on project needs. The pattern system enables teams to create agent systems that are both powerful and aligned with their values and goals.
