# Factory Components Reference

> **Philosophy:** Factory components embody our [Culture and Values](../CULTURE_AND_VALUES.md)—Axiom 0 (Love and Trust) grounds every agent and skill.

## 1. Introduction

The Cursor Agent Factory is a meta-system that generates customized Cursor agent development systems for software projects. This document describes the **factory's own components** - the agents and skills that work together during project generation - as distinct from the components that are generated for target projects.

All factory components operate according to the core axioms (A0-A5) and implement the 5-layer architecture, ensuring consistent, trustworthy, and value-aligned behavior.

### What Are Factory Components?

Factory components are the agents and skills that orchestrate the project generation process. They:

- **Gather requirements** through structured questionnaires and collaborative workshops
- **Configure technology stacks** by matching requirements to blueprints
- **Generate artifacts** including agents, skills, knowledge files, and templates
- **Design workflows** that integrate with external systems like Jira and Confluence
- **Onboard existing repositories** non-destructively into the factory ecosystem

### Purpose of Factory Agents and Skills

Factory agents are specialized orchestrators that coordinate the generation workflow. Each agent has a specific responsibility:

- **Requirements Architect**: Guides users through the 5-layer requirements gathering process
- **Stack Builder**: Matches technology requirements to available blueprints
- **Template Generator**: Creates code and document templates for the target project
- **Knowledge Manager**: Structures domain knowledge into queryable JSON files
- **Workflow Designer**: Configures development workflows and MCP server integrations
- **Onboarding Architect**: Integrates factory capabilities into existing repositories
- **Workshop Facilitator**: Guides teams through collaborative workshop series

Factory skills are reusable capabilities that agents invoke to perform specific tasks. They encapsulate processes like axiom selection, methodology configuration, and artifact generation.

### How They Work Together

During project generation, agents coordinate through a sequential workflow:

1. **Requirements Architect** uses `requirements-gathering`, `purpose-definition`, and `axiom-selection` skills to capture all project requirements
2. **Stack Builder** uses `stack-configuration` to match requirements to blueprints
3. **Workflow Designer** uses `workflow-generation` to configure development workflows
4. **Knowledge Manager** uses `knowledge-generation` to create domain knowledge files
5. **Template Generator** uses `template-generation`, `agent-generation`, `skill-generation`, and `cursorrules-generation` to create all project artifacts

For team onboarding, the **Workshop Facilitator** orchestrates a 5-workshop series using `team-workshop-onboarding`, while the **Onboarding Architect** handles individual repository integration using `onboarding-flow`.

#### team-workshop-onboarding

**Name and Description**: Orchestrates a series of collaborative workshops that guide teams through vision-setting, ethics definition, technology selection, and agent design - generating a customized Cursor agent system through play and dialogue. Grounded in Axiom 0: Love and Trust.

**When to Use**: When a team (2+ people) wants to collaboratively design their Cursor agent system, when team alignment and shared vision are as important as technical configuration, when user says "team workshop", "collaborative onboarding", "workshop series", when multiple stakeholders need to contribute to agent system design.

**Process Steps**: Orchestrates 5 workshops: (1) Vision Quest (2-3 hours) - Future Headlines and Stakeholder Safari games to define mission and stakeholders, (2) Ethics Arena (2 hours) - Dilemma Duel and Value Auction games to establish ethical framework, (3) Stack Safari (2-3 hours) - Trade-Off Tetris and Architecture Pictionary games to explore technology, (4) Agent Assembly (3-4 hours) - Agent Trading Cards and Skill Bingo games to design agents and skills, (5) Integration Celebration (1.5-2 hours) - Demo Derby and Gratitude Circle games to finalize and celebrate. Each workshop includes opening/closing rituals, game facilitation, synthesis, and artifact generation.

**Integration with Agents**: Used by `workshop-facilitator` (primary orchestrator)

#### shell-platform

**Name and Description**: Handles platform-specific shell command considerations for Windows PowerShell and Unix shells. Ensures commands work correctly across different platforms.

**When to Use**: Before executing shell commands that may have platform-specific syntax, when writing git commit messages with multi-line content, when using heredoc, pipes, or other shell-specific constructs.

**Process Steps**: (1) Platform Detection (check user's OS: win32 → PowerShell, darwin/linux → bash/zsh), (2) Apply Platform-Specific Syntax (PowerShell: avoid heredoc, use multiple -m flags for git commits, use ; instead of &&; Unix: use standard bash syntax), (3) Validate Command Syntax (ensure command matches target shell).

**Integration with Agents**: Used automatically by any agent executing shell commands (local scope, asks user before applying)

### Key Integration Points

- **Requirements Architect** orchestrates the initial gathering phase, coordinating `requirements-gathering`, `purpose-definition`, `axiom-selection`, and `stack-configuration` skills
- **Stack Builder** receives requirements and uses `stack-configuration` to match blueprints
- **Workflow Designer** uses `workflow-generation` to configure development workflows and MCP integrations
- **Knowledge Manager** uses `knowledge-generation` to create domain knowledge files
- **Template Generator** coordinates multiple generation skills (`template-generation`, `agent-generation`, `skill-generation`, `cursorrules-generation`) to create all project artifacts
- **Onboarding Architect** uses `onboarding-flow` as primary skill, with optional `requirements-gathering` and `stack-configuration` for customization
- **Workshop Facilitator** orchestrates `team-workshop-onboarding` which internally uses `axiom-selection`, `requirements-gathering`, and `methodology-selection` during workshops
- **Alignment Check** can be invoked by any agent before significant implementations
- **Pattern Feedback** can be invoked by any agent during retrospectives or pattern analysis
- **Knowledge Extender** uses `extend-knowledge` to research, synthesize, and create new Factory artifacts with mandatory post-extension automation
- **Knowledge Evolution** uses `update-knowledge` to apply external updates with merge strategies and rollback support
