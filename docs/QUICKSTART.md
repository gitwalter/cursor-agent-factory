# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to Cursor Agent Factory! This guide will have you up and running in just a few minutes.

---

## The Fastest Way to Start

Run this single command to see the factory in action:

```powershell
python cli/factory_cli.py --quickstart
```

That's it! In about 30 seconds, you'll have a complete demo project showing everything the factory can create.

---

## What Just Happened?

The `--quickstart` command created a demo project called **TaskMaster Demo** - an AI-powered task management API. Here's what you got:

## Understanding What You Got

### The Brain: `.cursorrules`

This file configures how AI agents behave in your project. It includes:

- **Layer 0**: Foundational axioms (reasoning, curiosity, humility)
- **Layer 1**: Your project's purpose and success criteria
- **Layer 2**: Ethical boundaries and quality standards
- **Layer 3**: Development methodology
- **Layer 4**: Technical configuration

Open it to see how the 5-layer architecture works!

### The Heart: `PURPOSE.md`

This document captures:

- **Mission**: What your project aims to achieve
- **Stakeholders**: Who you're building for
- **Success Criteria**: How you'll know you succeeded

### Your AI Team: `.cursor/agents/`

Each agent is a specialized AI assistant:

| Agent | What It Does |
|-------|--------------|
| **code-reviewer** | Reviews code against best practices and style guides |
| **test-generator** | Creates unit tests, integration tests, and test plans |
| **explorer** | Helps you understand and navigate codebases |

### Reusable Skills: `.cursor/skills/`

Skills are step-by-step procedures your agents can follow:

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|--------------|
| **bugfix-workflow** | Fix bugs using ticket information |
| **feature-workflow** | Implement features from specifications |
| **tdd** | Test-driven development process |
| **grounding** | Verify data before implementation |

## Try It Out

### Step 1: Open in Cursor IDE

Open the `quickstart-demo` folder in Cursor IDE.

### Step 2: Explore with Your AI Team

Try these prompts to see your agents in action:

**Ask the Explorer:**
> "Help me understand the structure of this project"

**Ask the Code Reviewer:**
> "Review the .cursorrules file and explain its sections"

**Ask for Test Generation:**
> "Create a test plan for a new task endpoint"

### Step 3: Try a Workflow

Say something like:
> "I need to add a new endpoint to create tasks. Walk me through the feature workflow."

Your agent will guide you through the feature-workflow skill step by step!

## Customizing Your Demo

### Use a Different Blueprint

The quickstart uses `python-fastapi` by default. Try other blueprints:

```powershell
# TypeScript/React
python cli/factory_cli.py --quickstart --quickstart-blueprint typescript-react

# Next.js Full-Stack
python cli/factory_cli.py --quickstart --quickstart-blueprint nextjs-fullstack

# AI Agent Development
python cli/factory_cli.py --quickstart --quickstart-blueprint ai-agent-development

# SAP ABAP
python cli/factory_cli.py --quickstart --quickstart-blueprint sap-abap
```

### Choose a Different Output Location

```powershell
python cli/factory_cli.py --quickstart --quickstart-output C:\Projects\my-demo
```

---

## Ready for More?

Now that you've seen what the factory creates, you're ready to build your own project!

### Option A: Interactive Mode (Recommended)

Answer questions to customize everything:

```powershell
python cli/factory_cli.py --interactive --output C:\Projects\my-project
```

You'll be guided through:
1. **Project Context** - Name, description, domain
2. **Technology Stack** - Language, frameworks
3. **Workflow Methodology** - Agile, Kanban, etc.
4. **Agent Capabilities** - Which agents you need
5. **Integrations** - Jira, Confluence, GitHub

### Option B: Blueprint-Based

Start from a pre-configured blueprint and customize later:

```powershell
python cli/factory_cli.py --blueprint python-fastapi --output C:\Projects\my-api
```

### Option C: Chat-Based (In Cursor IDE)

Open the factory project in Cursor and say:
> "Create a new agent system for my e-commerce platform"

The AI will guide you through the full requirements process.

## For Teams

If you're working with a team, consider the **Team Workshop** approach:

1. Say: **"We want to run team workshops for our project"**
2. Complete 5 collaborative workshops (11-15 hours total)
3. Align your team on vision, values, and technology
4. Generate a system everyone believes in

See the [Team Workshop Guide](TEAM_WORKSHOP_GUIDE.md) for details.
