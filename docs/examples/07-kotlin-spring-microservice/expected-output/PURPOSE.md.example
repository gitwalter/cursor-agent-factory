# Inventory Service - Purpose Document

## Mission Statement

To accelerate Kotlin microservice development with idiomatic patterns and reactive programming.

## Why This System Exists

1. **Kotlin Adoption**: Teams adopting Kotlin need guidance on idiomatic patterns. This system enforces best practices.

2. **Reactive Complexity**: Reactive programming requires specific patterns. This system ensures correct usage.

3. **Consistency**: Without guidance, code quality varies. This system maintains standards.

## Primary Stakeholders

### Kotlin Developers (Primary)
- **Who**: 2-4 developers building the microservice
- **Needs**: Idiomatic Kotlin, reactive patterns
- **Value**: Faster development, consistent quality

## Success Criteria

### Primary Metric
**Fully reactive, Kotlin-idiomatic code with 85% test coverage**

### Quality Metrics
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Test Coverage | >= 85% |
| ktlint Errors | 0 |
| Detekt Critical | 0 |
| Blocking Calls | 0 |

## Values Alignment

| Value | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| **Verifiability** | Kotest specs prove correctness |
| **Consistency** | Kotlin style guide enforced |
| **Minimalism** | Concise, expressive code |
