# Doc QA Bot - Purpose Document

## Mission Statement

To enable developers to get accurate, sourced answers from documentation through natural language queries.

## Why This System Exists

This agent system exists to solve the following problems:

1. **Documentation Overload**: Modern projects have extensive documentation spread across multiple sources. Finding specific information quickly is challenging.

2. **Context Switching**: Developers lose flow when they must leave their IDE to search documentation. An in-context Q&A system reduces friction.

3. **Accuracy Concerns**: Generic LLMs can hallucinate. A RAG-based system grounds answers in actual documentation, improving reliability.

4. **Institutional Knowledge**: Documentation often contains implicit knowledge that's hard to find with keyword search. Semantic search surfaces relevant content.

## Primary Stakeholders

### Developers (Primary)
- **Who**: Engineers working with documented systems
- **Needs**: Quick, accurate answers without leaving their workflow
- **Value**: Reduced time searching, higher confidence in answers

### Technical Writers (Secondary)
- **Who**: Documentation maintainers
- **Needs**: Insights into what questions are asked, gaps in documentation
- **Value**: Feedback loop for documentation improvement

## Success Criteria

### Primary Metric
**Answer 80% of documentation questions accurately with proper source citations**

Measured by:
- User feedback (thumbs up/down)
- Source verification audits
- Comparison with expert answers

### Quality Metrics
| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Answer Accuracy | ≥ 80% | User feedback + spot checks |
| Source Citation Rate | 100% | Automated check |
| Response Time | < 3 seconds | P95 latency |
| Hallucination Rate | < 5% | Manual audit sample |

### Learning Metrics (A10)
| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Prompt Improvement Rate | Monthly | Version comparison |
| Feedback Response Rate | > 10% | Users providing feedback |
| Failure Pattern Resolution | Weekly | Issue tracking |

## Alignment Check

Before responding to any query, verify:

1. **Grounded**: Is the answer derived from retrieved documents?
2. **Cited**: Are sources clearly referenced?
3. **Helpful**: Does this actually answer the user's question?
4. **Honest**: If uncertain, is that uncertainty communicated?

## Boundaries

### In Scope
- Answering questions about indexed documentation
- Providing code examples from documentation
- Explaining concepts with source references
- Follow-up questions with conversation context

### Out of Scope
- General knowledge questions (not in docs)
- Generating new code not from documentation
- Opinions or recommendations beyond docs
- Real-time data or current events

## Values Alignment

This system embodies:

| Value | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| **Verifiability** | Every answer cites sources |
| **Transparency** | Shows retrieved context on request |
| **Non-Harm** | Admits uncertainty rather than guessing |
| **Learning** | Improves from feedback continuously |

## A10 (Learning) Implementation

### Feedback Collection
- Thumbs up/down on answers
- "This didn't help" option with reason
- Query logs for pattern analysis

### Improvement Cycle
1. Weekly review of low-rated answers
2. Identify prompt or retrieval issues
3. Experiment with improvements
4. Measure impact on accuracy

### Experiment Tracking
- All prompt versions in version control
- A/B tests documented with results
- Learnings shared in team retrospectives
