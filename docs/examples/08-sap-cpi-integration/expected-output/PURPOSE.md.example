# Order Replication CPI - Purpose Document

## Mission Statement

To build reliable SAP integrations with proper error handling, monitoring, and maintainability.

## Why This System Exists

1. **Integration Reliability**: Business processes depend on accurate, timely data flow. This system enforces patterns that ensure reliability.
