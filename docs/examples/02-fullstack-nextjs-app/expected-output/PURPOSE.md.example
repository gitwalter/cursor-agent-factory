# TaskFlow App - Purpose Document

## Mission Statement

To accelerate full-stack React development with type-safe patterns from database to UI.

## Why This System Exists

1. **Full-Stack Complexity**: Building features that span database, API, and UI requires coordinating multiple layers. This system provides patterns that work together.

2. **Type Safety Gaps**: Without careful attention, type safety breaks at layer boundaries. This system enforces end-to-end typing.

3. **Boilerplate Reduction**: Common patterns (CRUD, auth, forms) are repetitive. This system automates the predictable parts.

## Primary Stakeholders

### Full-Stack Developers (Primary)
- **Who**: 2-4 developers building the application
- **Needs**: Fast, type-safe feature development
- **Value**: Reduced implementation time, fewer bugs

## Success Criteria

### Primary Metric
**Implement complete features from database to UI in under 2 hours**

### Quality Metrics
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Type Coverage | 100% (no any) |
| Lighthouse Score | >= 90 |
| Test Coverage | >= 80% |

## Values Alignment

| Value | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| **Verifiability** | Type safety proves correctness |
| **Transparency** | Clear component boundaries |
| **Consistency** | Standard patterns throughout |
