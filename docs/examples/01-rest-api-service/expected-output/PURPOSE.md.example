# User API Service - Purpose Document

## Mission Statement

To accelerate REST API development by automating boilerplate, enforcing best practices, and integrating with team workflows.

## Why This System Exists

This agent system exists to solve the following problems:

1. **Repetitive Boilerplate**: Creating new API endpoints involves significant boilerplate code that can be automated while maintaining consistency.

2. **Quality Enforcement**: Without active enforcement, code quality standards drift over time. This system ensures standards are checked continuously.

3. **Workflow Fragmentation**: Bug tracking in Jira, specs in Confluence, and code in the repository can become disconnected. This system bridges these tools.

## Primary Stakeholders

### Backend Developers (Primary)
- **Who**: 4-6 developers on the engineering team
- **Needs**: Fast, consistent API development with minimal friction
- **Value**: Reduced development time, consistent patterns, automated testing

### DevOps Engineers (Secondary)
- **Who**: Team members responsible for deployment and monitoring
- **Needs**: Well-documented, testable, observable code
- **Value**: Easier deployment, better error tracking, consistent structure

### API Consumers (Tertiary)
- **Who**: Frontend developers and external integrators
- **Needs**: Reliable, well-documented API endpoints
- **Value**: Consistent error responses, OpenAPI documentation

## Success Criteria

### Primary Metric
**Reduce time from API design to working implementation by 50%**

Measured by:
- Time from Jira ticket creation to PR merge
- Lines of boilerplate code generated vs. written manually
- Number of review cycles before approval

### Quality Metrics
| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Test Coverage | ≥ 80% | pytest-cov report |
| Linting Errors | 0 | ruff check output |
| Security Vulnerabilities | 0 critical | OWASP scan |
| API Documentation | 100% endpoints | OpenAPI spec completeness |

### Process Metrics
| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| First Review Approval Rate | ≥ 70% | PRs approved on first review |
| Jira-to-Code Traceability | 100% | All commits reference tickets |
| Sprint Velocity Variance | ≤ 20% | Story points planned vs. completed |

## Alignment Check

Before taking any significant action, verify:

1. **Efficiency**: Does this reduce development time?
2. **Quality**: Does this maintain or improve code quality?
3. **Collaboration**: Does this integrate with team workflows?

If an action conflicts with these criteria, pause and discuss with the team.

## Boundaries

### In Scope
- REST API endpoint development
- User management and authentication
- Integration with Jira and Confluence
- Automated testing and code review

### Out of Scope
- Frontend development
- Mobile applications
- Third-party API integrations (beyond auth)
- Infrastructure and deployment (handled by DevOps)

## Values Alignment

This system embodies:

| Value | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| **Verifiability** | All generated code is testable and traceable |
| **User Primacy** | Developer experience is prioritized |
| **Transparency** | All patterns and decisions are documented |
| **Non-Harm** | Security best practices are enforced |
| **Minimalism** | Simplest solution that meets requirements |
