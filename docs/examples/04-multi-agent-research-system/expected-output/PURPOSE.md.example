# Research Agent Team - Purpose Document

## Mission Statement

To automate complex research tasks through coordinated specialist agents working under intelligent supervision.

## Why This System Exists

1. **Research Complexity**: Multi-step research requires different skills (gathering, analysis, writing, review). Specialized agents handle each stage.

2. **Quality Assurance**: A critic agent ensures all outputs meet quality standards before delivery.

3. **Scalability**: The supervisor pattern allows adding new specialist agents without redesigning the system.

## Primary Stakeholders

### AI Engineers (Primary)
- **Who**: Developers building multi-agent systems
- **Needs**: Clear patterns, reliable coordination
- **Value**: Reference implementation for multi-agent orchestration

### Researchers (Secondary)
- **Who**: Users needing automated research
- **Needs**: Quality outputs, source verification
- **Value**: Accelerated research process

## Success Criteria

### Primary Metric
**Complete multi-step research tasks with quality-reviewed outputs**

### Quality Metrics
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Task Completion Rate | >= 90% |
| Source Citation Rate | 100% |
| Revision Cycles | <= 3 |
| User Satisfaction | >= 4/5 |

### Coordination Metrics
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
