# Product Catalog API - Purpose Document

## Mission Statement

To accelerate enterprise API development with Clean Architecture patterns, ensuring maintainability and testability.

## Why This System Exists

1. **Architecture Drift**: Without enforcement, Clean Architecture boundaries erode over time. This system maintains layer separation.

2. **Testing Complexity**: Enterprise APIs require comprehensive testing. This system generates tests following best practices.

3. **Onboarding Friction**: New developers need time to learn architecture patterns. This system codifies and enforces them.

## Primary Stakeholders

### .NET Developers (Primary)
- **Who**: 4-8 engineers building the API
- **Needs**: Clear patterns, fast development, high quality
- **Value**: Consistent codebase, automated testing

### API Consumers (Secondary)
- **Who**: Frontend developers, integration partners
- **Needs**: Reliable, well-documented API
- **Value**: Consistent contracts, clear error messages

## Success Criteria

### Primary Metric
**90% test coverage on business logic (Application + Domain layers)**

### Quality Metrics
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Test Coverage (Domain) | >= 90% |
| Test Coverage (Application) | >= 90% |
| Architecture Compliance | 100% |
| Security Vulnerabilities | 0 critical |

## Values Alignment

| Value | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| **Verifiability** | Tests prove correctness |
| **Transparency** | Clear layer boundaries |
| **Minimalism** | Essential complexity only |

## Boundaries

### In Scope
- Product catalog CRUD operations
- Inventory management
- Pricing and discounts
- Search and filtering

### Out of Scope
- User authentication (external identity provider)
- Payment processing
- Frontend applications
