# Example 05: SAP Fiori Integration

Build an SAP RAP (RESTful ABAP Programming) application with Fiori Elements UI, grounded in SAP documentation via MCP integration.

## What We're Building

A **Travel Booking Application** (RAP) that provides:

- RAP Business Objects with draft handling
- Fiori Elements List Report and Object Page
- CDS Views for data modeling
- Behavior definitions and implementations
- SAP documentation grounding via MCP

## Target Users

- **Primary**: SAP ABAP developers building Fiori applications
- **Secondary**: SAP consultants implementing S/4HANA extensions

## Success Criteria

- 100% compliance with SAP RAP guidelines
- All code grounded in official SAP documentation
- Clean Code principles for ABAP

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Backend | ABAP Cloud / RAP |
| Frontend | SAP Fiori Elements |
| Data Model | CDS Views |
| OData | V4 |
| Environment | SAP BTP or S/4HANA |

## Factory Configuration Summary

| Layer | Configuration |
|-------|---------------|
| **Layer 0 (Axioms)** | Core (A1-A5) + A6 (Minimalism) + A7 (Reversibility) |
| **Layer 1 (Purpose)** | SAP-grounded development |
| **Layer 2 (Principles)** | SAP best practices |
| **Layer 3 (Methodology)** | Enterprise Integration |
| **Layer 4 (Technical)** | sap-abap blueprint |

## Depth Level

**Comprehensive** - Includes enforcement patterns and practices for enterprise SAP development.

## Key Feature: SAP Documentation Grounding

This example uses the **SAP Documentation MCP Server** to:
- Query SAP Help Portal for syntax and patterns
- Verify code against official documentation
- Ensure compliance with SAP guidelines

## Time to Complete

Following this walkthrough takes approximately **25-30 minutes**.
