# Travel Booking RAP - Purpose Document

## Mission Statement

To accelerate SAP RAP development by grounding all code in official documentation and enforcing SAP best practices.

## Why This System Exists

1. **Documentation Gaps**: SAP has extensive documentation, but developers often miss relevant guidelines. MCP grounding ensures compliance.

2. **Pattern Consistency**: RAP has specific patterns that must be followed. This system enforces them automatically.

3. **Enterprise Risk**: SAP systems are business-critical. Proper enforcement reduces risk of system issues.

## Primary Stakeholders

### SAP ABAP Developers (Primary)
- **Who**: 4-8 developers building RAP applications
- **Needs**: Accurate patterns, documented code, compliance
- **Value**: Faster development, fewer errors

### SAP Basis Team (Secondary)
- **Who**: System administrators
- **Needs**: Clean transports, no system impact
- **Value**: Stable system operations

### Business Users (Tertiary)
- **Who**: End users of Fiori applications
- **Needs**: Reliable, performant applications
- **Value**: Productive work tools
